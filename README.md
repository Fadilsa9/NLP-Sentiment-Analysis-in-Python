# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-in-Python
Machine learning project

## Overview

This project focuses on performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis using Python. It utilizes the NumPy library for data manipulation and pandas for handling datasets. The primary objective is to analyze customer reviews and assign sentiment scores based on the content of those reviews.

## Contents

- **Data Analysis**: The project includes a dataset of reviews along with corresponding sentiment scores.
- **NLP Techniques**: Various NLP techniques are applied to extract meaningful insights from the text data.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
```

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

1. **Data Preparation**: The reviews and their corresponding scores are loaded into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: The sentiment of each review is determined based on the assigned scores.

### Code Snippet

Here is a brief overview of the code used in this project:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Sample reviews and scores
review = np.array([
    'Stunning even for the non-gamer: This soundtrack was beautiful!',
    'The best soundtrack ever to anything.',
    'Amazing!: This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time.',
    # Add more reviews as needed
])

score = np.array([1, 1, 1])  # Corresponding sentiment scores

# Create a DataFrame
reviews = pd.DataFrame({'review': review, 'score': score})

# Display the first few entries
print(reviews.head())
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open your Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).
3. Load the dataset and run the provided code to analyze the reviews.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a foundational step in understanding how to implement NLP and sentiment analysis using Python. It can be expanded with more sophisticated techniques, such as machine learning models for sentiment classification.
